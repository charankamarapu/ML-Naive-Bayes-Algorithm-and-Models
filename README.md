# ML-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-and-Models

## INTRODUCTION
- Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.
- Generally we have features for a particular class , they may be co-related and have something in common but in the context of this  algorithm we assume that all features are completely independent of each other.
- Let us look at the formula of Bayes' theorem of single feature
